This is a distilled version of the F# version found

- `GildedRose` with the original program.
- `GildedRose.UnitTests` where you can write the unit tests. Added some items that may be useful for tests.
- `GildedRose.ApprovalTests` which contains the code approval test (for the original use cases.)
